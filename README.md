# nvim

My new config for neovim using Lua

## References

- Heavily based on https://github.com/brainfucksec/neovim-lua
- Addition config for `nvim-cmp` from https://github.com/hackorum/nfs/blob/master/lua/lsp/cmp.lua

## What works

- [x] gruvbox
- [x] lsp for python (jedi)
- [x] "TAB" to jump between arguments of function (and also jump out)
- [x] treesitter
- [x] indent
- [x] file browser with nvim-tree
- [x] lsp signature
- [x] minimal keymaps
- [x] gruvbox coloscheme setting from lua, not by calling vim command
- [x] pyright diagnostics 
- [ ] Telescope
